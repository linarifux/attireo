              <p>
                At Attireo, we believe that style and sustainability are not mutually exclusive. We are on a journey to make thoughtful decisions at every step, reducing our impact on the planet while creating high-quality apparel that lasts.
              </p>

            <PolicySection title="Sustainable Materials">
              <p>
                We are increasing our use of sustainable materials year over year. This includes sourcing GOTS-certified organic cotton, recycled polyester, linen, and TENCELâ„¢ Lyocell. These choices help reduce water usage, carbon emissions, and waste.
              </p>
            </PolicySection>

            <PolicySection title="Ethical Production">
              <p>
                A sustainable future includes the people who make our clothes. We are committed to a transparent supply chain and partner exclusively with factories that guarantee fair wages, safe working conditions, and respect for workers' rights.
              </p>

            <PolicySection title="Our Packaging">
              <p>
                We've eliminated single-use plastics from our shipping. All orders are sent in mailers made from 100% recycled and recyclable materials. Our tags are printed on recycled cardstock with soy-based inks.
              </p>
            </PolicySection>

            <PolicySection title="Our Progress">
              <p>
                We're not perfect, but we are committed to progress. We publish an annual sustainability report to share our achievements and the areas where we're still working to improve.
